# Automatic Learning

Open **Admin → Automatic Learning** to choose which Bots contribute completed conversations to a CopilotKit Intelligence Learning container and receive its published skills. Learning defaults on for managed and self-hosted deployments; a saved off setting is preserved. Collection and delivery require an existing, assigned container. OpenBot still starts and chats without one.

Desktop sign-in creates or reuses the selected project's `openbot` container. Managed setup uses CopilotKit sign-in; self-hosted setup uses that deployment's normal browser sign-in and requires installed Chrome or Edge. Start saves the assignment only while the provisioned key and API still match, and preserves an explicit custom container in `.env`. Saved Admin settings, including off or an empty default, remain authoritative.

For a fresh managed clone, copy `.env.example` to `.env`, then run from the OpenBot root:

```sh
bun install
npx --yes copilotkit@latest login
npx --yes copilotkit@latest project select
bun scripts/setup-learning.ts
```

The helper provisions a key for the selected project, creates or reuses its `openbot` container, and verifies the response before writing `INTELLIGENCE_API_KEY` and `CPK_INTELLIGENCE_LEARNING_CONTAINER_ID`. It preserves custom targets and refuses to replace an existing OpenBot runtime key.

For fresh self-hosted setup, set `INTELLIGENCE_API_URL` to the deployment's HTTPS API origin and run `bun scripts/setup-learning.ts` after `bun install`; skip the managed CLI commands. Install Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge first. The helper opens an isolated browser for your deployment's sign-in, lists your accessible projects, and creates or reuses `openbot` before minting a key for the chosen project. It keeps sign-in cookies only in that temporary browser and closes it on completion, cancellation, or timeout. HTTP is supported only for loopback development. Run this operator setup on a computer whose browser can reach Intelligence, including when preparing a remote web or Helm deployment; transfer the generated runtime key using your normal secret management and set the container ID to `openbot`.

A runtime key alone cannot create a container. Existing key-only deployments and custom container assignments use authenticated Intelligence administration and these manual steps:

1. In the same Intelligence project used by OpenBot, create a Learning container. Its stable ID contains 1–64 lowercase letters, digits, and single hyphens (for example, `support-learning`).
2. In OpenBot, enter the default container ID and re-enable Learning if previously paused. Leave the default empty to opt in only particular Bots. Each Bot can inherit the default, use another container, or be excluded. Save the settings.
3. Start **new threads** and complete relevant workflows. Chat, channels, scheduled routines, and handoffs use the same server-side settings. An existing thread keeps the first container assignment (including an unassigned first run); changing a Bot mapping does not move or backfill its earlier evidence.
4. Use **Manage Learning in Intelligence**, **View analysis runs**, and **Review skill candidates** on the Learning page. Intelligence collects evidence, runs analysis, and proposes skills. Review the source evidence and publish approved revisions in Intelligence. Neither a scheduled analysis nor enabling Learning automatically approves a skill.
5. Enable skill delivery for that container in Intelligence and start another Bot invocation. Published guidance is loaded into the Bot's governed run. An exact revision pin keeps a specific published revision; leaving it empty follows new publications after the refresh window. A loaded snapshot alone does not prove the model used a skill: inspect its skill tool calls too.

For live voice calls with a Learning-enabled Bot, substantive answers, explanations, recommendations, research, and actions are delegated through the existing `ask_agent` channel run. That selected Bot's AG-UI run and Rich Threads provide the Learning evidence and published guidance. Brief spoken acknowledgments, clarification, and reading or summarizing its returned answer remain audio and are not evidence. The voice session reads participation when it starts: restart the call after changing Learning settings. Neither the skill snapshot nor the Intelligence project key is sent to the realtime voice provider.

Pausing OpenBot Learning preserves its mappings and thread assignments. It stops new OpenBot assignments and delivery. Previously bound threads remain in their Intelligence containers; pause analysis in Intelligence to stop learning from those containers. Delivery uses the current per-Bot policy on fresh invocations. Intelligence's existing evidence, scheduled analysis, publication, and separate delivery controls remain managed there.

## Credentials and permissions

OpenBot reuses its **server-side** `INTELLIGENCE_API_KEY` and `INTELLIGENCE_API_URL`. Setup creates containers using the authenticated account, not the runtime key. Never put the project key in browser environment variables. The Learning settings and inspection endpoints require an OpenBot administrator; settings writes also require same-origin JSON requests (or an explicitly trusted app origin).

The project key supports runtime ingestion, skill delivery, and the read-only Inspector Learning projection. It is not a management credential. Review, run, schedule, and publish links open the existing Intelligence UI, where you sign in with an account authorized for that project. OpenBot does not proxy management writes using its project key.

The admin page reports evidence and published-skill counts, analysis status, and available delivery diagnostics. An unavailable status is displayed as an error with a retry action, not as an empty container. Server errors and project credentials are not exposed in those messages.

## Managed and self-hosted deployments

For managed Intelligence, keep the existing managed API and gateway configuration. Configure the container in its associated project. For an Enterprise self-hosted Intelligence deployment, use its API and gateway endpoints and the same project's key. Install the Intelligence release and migrations that support Automatic Learning, the Inspector Learning endpoint (`GET /api/inspector/learning`), and published skill delivery before assigning a container in OpenBot. Links come from that server's configured web-app origin, so self-hosted administration opens the correct UI.

OpenBot's database migration adds `learning_settings` and `learning_thread_bindings`; run the normal deployment migrations. The settings are read from the database across replicas, and thread assignment is atomic.

Operators may seed an initial default in the API server environment:

```dotenv
CPK_INTELLIGENCE_LEARNING_CONTAINER_ID=support-learning
# Optional opaque published revision ID; omit to follow latest.
CPK_INTELLIGENCE_SKILLS_REVISION=exact-revision-id
```

These are optional defaults, not additional startup requirements. Once an administrator saves settings, those saved settings take precedence, including a saved off state. Helm exposes the defaults as `config.learning.containerId` and `config.learning.revision`. Local development reads them from `.env`; desktop installations can use the Admin page without modifying native configuration. The revision is an opaque ID, not a number to increment or a special `auto` value.

Built-in agents receive published guidance through the CopilotKit runtime. OpenBot's shipped remote agents receive the server-selected, verified skill snapshot for each run; they do not require the Intelligence project key. Bring-your-own remote agents must consume that forwarded context (or configure the framework's supported native adapter) to use delivered guidance; evidence collection alone does not alter a third-party agent's prompt. Keep existing tool grants, boundaries, credentials, and manually authored slash skills in place: learned guidance does not grant tools or replace them.
