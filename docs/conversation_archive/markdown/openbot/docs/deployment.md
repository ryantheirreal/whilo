# Deployment

OpenBot ships as one container. It carries the app, the API that serves it, and the browser the Bots
drive, and it can carry its own PostgreSQL as well. It does what it does on a laptop.

```sh
# Every release publishes this image, so a deployment needs no clone and no build.
# `latest` is the most recent; a version tag such as `:v0.0.9` pins one.
image=ghcr.io/copilotkit/openbot:latest

# A database you already run.
docker run -p 3001:3001 --env-file .env "$image"

# Or one inside the container. Nothing else to provision.
docker run -p 3001:3001 --env-file .env \
  -e EMBEDDED_POSTGRES=on -v openbot-data:/var/lib/postgresql "$image"
```

`docker build -t openbot .` from a clone produces the same thing, for anyone deploying a tree of
their own. What a release publishes is digest-pinned in its `container-images.json`, and deploying
those digests rather than a moving tag is what [releasing.md](releasing.md) recommends.

## What is in the image, and what is not

**In it:** the built app, the API, and Chromium. One port, 3001. The browser listens on 4100 inside
the container and is deliberately not published: it holds real logins and its only caller is the
process beside it.

**PostgreSQL, if you ask for it.** `EMBEDDED_POSTGRES=on` starts one inside the container, creates
the database and the `vector` extension the first time, and runs the migrations on every start. It
listens on loopback only and is never published, so there is no password to manage.

Give it a volume at `/var/lib/postgresql` — the parent, not the data directory itself. Without one,
a redeploy takes the audit trail with it, and the audit trail is the product.

**Mount the parent, not `/var/lib/postgresql/data`.** On any platform whose volume is an ext4 mount,
and that is most of them, the mount arrives holding a `lost+found` directory. `initdb` will not
initialise into a directory that has anything in it, so mounting it directly on the data directory
leaves the cluster uncreated — and because `api` waits on `postgres` and `migrate`, the container
starts, the platform reports the deploy a success, and the URL serves a 502. Mounting the parent
leaves `data` as an ordinary subdirectory, which is what PostgreSQL asks for. A Docker named volume
works either way; a platform volume does not. Platforms that offer no persistent volume are the ones to
point at a managed database instead: set `DATABASE_URL` and leave `EMBEDDED_POSTGRES` off. The
`vector` extension must be enabled there; RDS, Cloud SQL and Azure Database all support it, none
enable it for you.

**Not in it:**

**The supervisor.** It gives each Bot its own container, which needs a Docker socket, which no
serverless container platform permits. Without it, every Bot shares the one browser, exactly as they
do on a laptop with no supervisor configured. A shared browser means shared logins, shared files and
shared session between Bots, which is fine for a deployment where one team trusts its own Bots and
is not fine as a boundary between tenants.

**The routines schedule.** Nothing in this image is scheduled to fire a routine — there is no
worker service beside the API, and `worker/` (the looping local variant) is not in the image. The
sweep itself is: `bun scripts/fire-routines.ts` from `/app/server`, one pass then exit, which is what
the Helm chart's CronJob runs from this same image. So a one-container deployment needs something
outside the container to run it on a schedule — an external cron, a platform scheduled job, or a
second container of this image started with `--entrypoint sh` (without it the command arrives as a
`CMD`, and this image's entrypoint boots a whole second server before it runs one; see
[Migrations](#migrations)) — with `SERVER_INTERNAL_URL` and
`WORKER_SHARED_SECRET` set **on top of this server's whole environment**, not instead of it. That
sweep builds the same configuration the API server does before it looks for a due routine, so it
refuses to start without the encryption key, the Intelligence values and an identity provider,
exactly as the server does: give it the same env file and add those two. Until something does, a
routine is stored, its next run time is computed, the Routines page shows it, and it never fires.
See [routines.md](routines.md).

**The staged-attachment sweep.** Same shape as the routines schedule, with a consequence worth
stating on its own: a file dropped into the composer is stored before it is sent, and nothing in
this image reclaims the ones that never were. The sweep is `bun scripts/cull-staged-attachments.ts`
from `/app/server`, one pass then exit, which the Helm chart runs hourly and which deletes unsent
attachments older than 24 hours — the window is the script's one positional argument, so
`bun scripts/cull-staged-attachments.ts 72` keeps them for three days, and a fraction is a fraction
of an hour. It needs only `DATABASE_URL` — no encryption key, no identity provider, nothing else
this image is configured with — so unlike the routines sweep above, an external cron can run it
with one variable set. A second container of this image still needs `--entrypoint sh`, for the
reason under [Migrations](#migrations).

Until something does, abandoned uploads accumulate in `attachments` up to a ceiling that is one
person's: **32 unsent files each**, counted across every channel and every composer session at once
and refused at the upload endpoint. A file is at most 8 MiB, so that is 256 MiB of staged blobs per
person who uploads, and that is the number to size storage against. It is **not** the eight files
the composer refuses a ninth on: that cap is counted over a bucket the client names in its own
request, so it bounds a client that plays along and nothing else, which is exactly why the
per-person ceiling was added behind it.

That ceiling is also why never running this sweep is worse than growth. The refusal a person sees on
their 33rd staged file tells them anything still unsent is cleared within a day — which is a promise
made on this sweep's behalf. With nothing running it, the files are never cleared, and anybody who
reaches 32 can attach nothing, in any channel, for good.

## Minimum size

Measured on the real image, one Bot, arm64.

| | Measured | Minimum | Recommended |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Memory | 409 MB idle, 498 MB after three page loads, 548 MB after a snapshot | **2 GB** | **4 GB** |
| vCPU | 3 to 6 percent at rest, bursty while a page renders | **1** | **2** |
| Disk | 1.4 GB image | **4 GB** | 8 GB with room for `/workspace` |

**Why 2 GB when it measures at 550 MB.** That figure is one Bot with one page open. Every additional
concurrent page is roughly another 100 to 200 MB, and Playwright's own guidance is to allow about
1 GB per concurrent browser. 2 GB is the floor at which one person using it does not meet the OOM
killer; 4 GB is where a handful of Bots working at once stays comfortable.

**Do not configure shared memory.** Chromium is launched with `--disable-dev-shm-usage`, so it writes
to `/tmp` rather than `/dev/shm` and the 64 MB default is irrelevant. This matters because **AWS
Fargate does not support `sharedMemorySize` at all**; without that flag Chromium would crash there
and the fix would not be available.

## Required configuration

| Variable | |
| --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL with the `vector` extension. Not needed with `EMBEDDED_POSTGRES=on` |
| an identity provider | `GOOGLE_OAUTH_*`, `MICROSOFT_OAUTH_*` or `OKTA_OAUTH_*`, with `BETTER_AUTH_URL`, `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` and `INITIAL_ADMIN_EMAILS`. See the README |
| `EMBEDDED_POSTGRES` | `on` to run the database inside the container. Off by default |
| `KEY_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | base64 32 bytes. `openssl rand -base64 32`. The example key is refused in production |
| `INTELLIGENCE_API_URL`, `INTELLIGENCE_GATEWAY_WS_URL`, `INTELLIGENCE_API_KEY` | CopilotKit Intelligence. A free plan is available and it can be self-hosted |
| `COPILOTKIT_LICENSE_TOKEN` | optional. Managed Intelligence issues none; set it only for a self-hosted Intelligence that has one |
| a model key | `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or the provider you configured |

`COMPUTER_TOKEN` is generated at start if you do not set one. Both processes that need it are inside
the container, so there is nothing to share it with.

`MANAGED_AGENT_AG_UI_URL` is not required here. The image does not carry `agent-langgraph` or
`agent-bot`. Leave it unset and the shipped Risk Analyst coworker is omitted rather than registered
against a host that is not there. Set it, with `MANAGED_AGENT_TOKEN`, only when a Bot is actually
reachable from this container. Unset it if your `.env` still has the laptop default
`http://localhost:4201/ag-ui`.

**Authentication is required.** With no identity provider configured, the deployment refuses to start,
because a public URL where every visitor is an administrator fails silently: it looks like it works.
Configure Google, Microsoft or Okta, or set `OPENBOT_SINGLE_USER=true` to say you meant an open
deployment. `NODE_ENV` does not affect this.

That flag does not cover a public address. `OPENBOT_SINGLE_USER=true` alongside an
`OPENBOT_PUBLIC_URL`, `OPENBOT_APP_URL` or `TRUSTED_ORIGINS` entry that the public internet routes
to now refuses to start and names the address, because an open deployment on a public address is
one where every visitor is the administrator. A private address is a different thing and still
runs: a home LAN, a Tailscale or VPN address, or a `.local` name is allowed, with a warning at boot
saying anybody on that network is that administrator. If you want it open on a public address,
put a sign-in provider in front of it.

**Put TLS in front of it.** Not only for the cookies. A page served from `http://<address>` is not a
secure context, which removes a set of browser APIs that are present on `http://localhost` and so
never missing on a laptop. The app does not depend on any of them, but sign-in cookies still want
`Secure`, and every platform below terminates TLS for you.

## Migrations

With `EMBEDDED_POSTGRES=on` they run at start and there is nothing to do. There is exactly one
process and no deploy pipeline, so the alternative would be a runbook.

With an external database, they are a release step, not a start step. Two replicas starting together
would race, and a failed migration should stop a deploy rather than leave a half-migrated database
serving traffic.

```sh
docker run --rm --env-file .env --entrypoint sh openbot \
  -c "cd /app/server && bun scripts/migrate.ts"
```

**`--entrypoint sh`, and it is the load-bearing part of that command.** This image's entrypoint is
`/init`, which is s6's, and anything after the image name is a `CMD` — which s6 runs *after* it has
started everything in the image. Without the override, `docker run … openbot sh -c "… migrate.ts"`
brings up the API and Chromium against the database you have not migrated yet, and only then
migrates it: a second server on an unmigrated schema, which is the race this whole section exists to
avoid, in the one command meant to avoid it. Replacing the entrypoint runs the migration and nothing
else. The Helm chart's migration Job is the same thing said in Kubernetes' terms — it sets
`command:`, which overrides an image's entrypoint rather than appending to it — which is why that
path was never wrong and this one was.

`scripts/migrate.ts`, not `drizzle-kit migrate`. The CLI is a development dependency and this image
is built with `bun install --production`, so it is not in there; it also needs esbuild to read its
TypeScript config. Asked to migrate here it exits 1 without saying why, and the deployment comes up
against an empty database. The script uses the migrator inside `drizzle-orm`, which is a runtime
dependency, and keeps the same journal, so a database migrated by either is migrated. It is what
this image's own start-up path and the Helm chart's migration Job both run.

## Replicas

The page snapshot a Bot resolves element references against lives in Postgres, so a second replica
can answer a click the first one snapshotted. Run more than one if the platform wants it. The
supervisor is still not in this image, so every replica shares the one browser inside it.

## Platform notes

**Google Cloud Run.** Set memory to at least 2 GB. More than one instance is fine (see Replicas
above); each instance has its own browser, so a Bot's logins stay on whichever instance served them.
Cloud Run runs every
container under gVisor, which Chromium is sensitive to; test a navigation before trusting it.
`gcloud run compose up` will also deploy the whole compose file if you want a throwaway database
alongside.

**AWS.** ECS Express Mode provisions the cluster, load balancer, HTTPS and autoscaling from an image
in ECR, and is what AWS points App Runner users at now that App Runner takes no new customers.
Plain ECS on Fargate behind an ALB is the answer if you want task definitions and fine-grained IAM.
No shared-memory configuration is needed or possible.

**Kubernetes.** Everything above describes one container run by hand. A cluster is the other shape,
and it is the only one that gives a Bot a computer of its own, runs the routines schedule without
something outside the container, and scales the API past a single replica. That is the Helm chart:
[charts/openbot/README.md](../charts/openbot/README.md), which covers EKS, GKE, AKS and a plain
self-hosted cluster from the same templates.

**Azure Container Apps.** Managed ingress with TLS and custom domains. Note the **240-second request
timeout**: the live screen holds a long connection, so expect it to reconnect. Concurrent WebSockets
are capped at 350 per instance on the basic tier.

**Railway, Render, Fly.io.** All run this image directly and all provision PostgreSQL in a click,
which makes them the shortest path from nothing to a running deployment.

## Known costs

**The browser images carry only the Chromium browser family.** The all-in-one Dockerfile and the
published `agent-computer` Dockerfile both build from Ubuntu and run Playwright's pinned
`install --with-deps chromium` path, so Firefox and WebKit are never introduced into the final image
layers. Keep that Playwright version matched to `agent-computer/package.json`; changing one without
the other can make the browser protocol and executable revision diverge. The images keep the
baseline Node command-line tools (`node`, `npm`, and `npx`) from the official Node 24.18.1 image.
Measured as local zstd OCI layer descriptors against the previous Playwright-base `agent-computer`
image, the compressed image fell from 884.2 MiB to 535.0 MiB on arm64 and from 894.6 MiB to
518.1 MiB on amd64.

**A strict content-security-policy needs a hash or a nonce.** `app/index.html` runs a small inline
script that decides the theme before the first paint. Nothing in this repo sends a CSP header, so it
works as shipped; a deployment that adds one at its proxy has to allow that script explicitly, or
`script-src` blocks it and the page renders with the wrong theme until the app boots. A `'sha256-'`
hash of the script body is the version that survives a rebuild without a per-request nonce.
