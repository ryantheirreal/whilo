# Coworkers

A coworker is a Bot with a durable profile and standing role. The role is sent with every run so the user does not have to restate the job in each channel.

## Data model

| Piece                | Table                           | Purpose                                                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Runtime agent        | `agents`                        | Type (built-in, remote AG-UI or remote Mastra), endpoint or prompt, optional key reference. |
| Profile              | `agent_profiles`                | Name, title, role, avatar seed, owner, visibility, and soft deletion.                    |
| Personal roster      | `agent_preferences`             | Per-user hidden and pinned state.                                                        |
| Team publication     | `team_bot_publications`         | A Bot its owner has published to the whole team or to named people and groups.          |
| Channel              | `channels`                      | Conversation membership and coworker binding.                                            |
| Intelligence mapping | `intelligence_channel_mappings` | Channel-to-thread mapping.                                                               |

Package-provided agents are public and ownerless. User-created coworkers are owned by the creator.

## Standing role

Remote coworkers receive a system message derived from their title and role description:

```text
You are Expense Manager, Finance Operations.

Review receipts, categorize expenses, and prepare reimbursement reports.

This standing role applies in every channel. Treat channel messages as task-specific instructions within it.
```

A further provenance block is appended by the deployment rather than the package: it tells the
coworker to say where each answer came from, to mark plainly anything it answers from its own
knowledge rather than from a source, and never to present the latter as the former. A second block
tells it how to read the untrusted-content envelope its tool results carry. Being deployment-wide,
both cannot be forgotten from the next coworker somebody adds.

The message is ordinary AG-UI system content, so it works with any AG-UI-compatible backend. Editing the role affects the next run.

## Visibility

| Visibility | Who can see and run it      |
| ---------- | --------------------------- |
| `private`  | Owner and administrators.   |
| `public`   | Everyone in the deployment. |

Filtering happens in server/database queries. Package-provided agents cannot be edited or deleted through the product.

An owner can also publish a Bot as a Team Bot, to everybody signed in or to named people and groups
(`/api/team-bots`, the **Team Bots** screen). Publishing is a separate, revocable record; the Bot's own
visibility is unchanged by it. A published Bot stays invisible to teammates until it has a role
description and a name other than a placeholder such as "New Bot".

## Channels

Starting a channel creates a new conversation and Intelligence thread. Two channels with the same coworker stay separate.

Each channel routes through a channel-local proxy agent id, pinned to that channel's thread id, then forwards to the coworker runtime id.

## Deleting and hiding

Deleting is soft. The coworker stops running, but existing channels remain readable for their members and restore as tombstones.

Hiding and pinning are personal roster state. Hiding removes the coworker from one user's list without disabling the coworker for anyone else; pinning moves it into the **Pinned** section at the top of `/agents` for that user only.

## Default endpoint

Product-created coworkers use:

```dotenv
MANAGED_AGENT_AG_UI_URL=http://localhost:4201/ag-ui
```

That is `agent-langgraph`, which runs a real framework and its own tool loop. The proof-of-concept on
`4200` hand-writes the protocol and leaves the loop to whatever is watching, so it is a reference
rather than something to build a deployment on.

The URL is optional. Set it with `MANAGED_AGENT_TOKEN`, or leave it unset: product-created coworkers
then need their own endpoint, and a package agent whose endpoint expands to nothing is omitted
rather than registered against a missing host. A leftover token with no URL is ignored.
Package-provided agents otherwise use their own `agents.yaml` configuration.

## Register an external AG-UI agent

In `agents.yaml`:

```yaml
agents:
  - id: risk
    name: Risk
    title: Risk & Compliance
    role_description: Investigate policies and controls.
    type: remote-ag-ui
    endpoint: http://risk.internal/ag-ui
```

In the product, create or edit a coworker from `/agents` and set:

- name;
- title;
- role description;
- visibility;
- optional endpoint;
- optional authorization header.

Endpoint registration uses target checks. Cloud metadata addresses are refused under every configuration. Optional keys are write-only: sending a key stores/replaces it, omitting it keeps the existing key, and APIs do not return it.

`POST /api/agents/test-connection` checks whether an endpoint answers before saving it.

## Capabilities

A coworker's role does not grant capabilities. Capabilities are governed separately:

- browser and file actions go through the computer gateway policy;
- components are published deployment-wide and can be withheld per Bot;
- MCP tools are granted per Bot by administrators;
- personal skills can be attached only to Bots the author owns;
- deployment skills are managed by administrators.
